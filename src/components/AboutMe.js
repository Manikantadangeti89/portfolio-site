          Hi! I'm Manikanta Dangeti, a passionate full-stack developer who loves building web
          applications that solve real-world problems. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about technology and
          constantly learning new tools and frameworks to improve my craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in the MERN stack, and I have experience creating clean UI designs,
          integrating with APIs, and managing databases. Apart from coding, I enjoy solving puzzles
          and diving into competitive programming challenges.
        </p> */}
        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Manikanta Dangeti ‚Äî a full-stack developer who‚Äôs as comfortable writing backend logic as 
            I am crafting intuitive frontends.My journey started with curiosity, grew through consistency, 
            and continues with a deep hunger to build meaningful digital experiences.

            <br/><br/>Over the years, I‚Äôve built a range of projects ‚Äî from recipe-sharing platforms to blood donation systems
            to rental websites ‚Äî not because I had to, but because I wanted to create something real. 
            I‚Äôm fluent in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Java, and SQL, and I‚Äôm always expanding my toolkit.

            <br/><br/>I value clean code, user-focused design, and continuous iteration.  
            But more than that, I value growth through action, even when it's messy.
            I'm not here just to get hired. I'm here to build, share, and make a mark.  
            If you're looking for someone who blends creative energy with technical execution ‚Äî let's connect.

            <br/><br/>üìç Always building. Always learning. Always leveling up.</p>
